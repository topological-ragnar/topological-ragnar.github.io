       <p>The <em>Hopf fibration</em> is a very special mathematical object relating the 1, 2, and 3 dimensional spheres.
         Precisely, it is a decomposition of the 3-sphere, that is, 3-dimensional space with a point at infinity, into a disjoint union
         of 1-spheres, that is, circles, such that each circle may be labelled by a coordinate on the 2-sphere, that is, the ordinary
         sphere. It has the additional special property that every pair of circles forms a simple link.

       <p>A deep theorem surrounding a
         phenomenon known as <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week105.html">Bott periodicity</a> says something
         like this exists only in 1, 3, 7, and 15 dimensions. Bott periodicity and the Hopf fibration appear everywhere, even in
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2686">condensed matter physics!</a>

       <p> This <a href="https://threejs.org">three.js</a> project was my very first, and I couldn't have done it without
         my buddy <a href="https://github.com/data-doge">data-doge</a> (Eugene Lynch) who is responsible for getting
         me into this crazy stuff! Also the <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/">CCRMA</a> deserves a shoutout, where
         we cranked out a lot of this stuff.
       </p>
       <p> Anyway, the piece consists of a sketchpad in the lower right, which represents a stereographic projection
         of the 2-sphere which parametrizes the circles. If you click in the sketchpad, this represents a point on the 2-sphere
         and the computer draws the corresponding circle. Try just a few clicks at first. Drag the image to see that the resulting
         circles are all linked in pairs. Then draw more points. There are some interesting ``features" to be explored in the menu.
       </p>

      <p>One can also toggle <em>fly-controls</em> by an option on the sketchpad:</p>
        <p><ul>
          <li> <em>w,a,s,d</em>     <span style="float:right;">lateral movement</span></li>
          <li> <em>q,e</em>     <span style="float:right;">roll</span></li>
          <li> <em>r,f</em>     <span style="float:right;">vertical movement</span></li>
          <li> <em>&uparrow; &downarrow; &leftarrow; &rightarrow;</em>  <span style="float:right;">pitch and yaw</span></li>
        </ul></p>
