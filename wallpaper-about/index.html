       <section>
       <p>A <a href="http://www.cryst.ehu.es/">crystal</a> is a spontaneously self-assembled repeating pattern of atoms.
         What does it mean that a pattern is repeating? It means that it has a <em>unit cell</em>,
       which is a small region which generates the whose crystal by a discrete group of translations.
     Thus a crystal is a pattern with a translation symmetry.</p>
     <p>Crystals can have other symmetries as well, such as rotations and reflections.
        In two dimensions there are exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group">17 ways</a> to combine translations with these other symmetries.
         In three dimensions there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group">230</a>.
         In four dimensions there are still more, and there are <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/602F11/References/Hiller.pdf">always finitely many.</a></p>
         <p>In this <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> app,
            the computer chooses one of the 17 so-called <em>wallpaper groups</em> and applies its symmetry elements to a user-drawn figure in real time.
            To draw, simply point the mouse and hold the spacebar. To refresh the canvas and choose a new wallpaper group, reload the page.
            Press c to toggle colors. One can also tilt the canvas by clicking and dragging. (Otherwise it was completely superfluous to make this project in a
             3d graphics engine. ;)
