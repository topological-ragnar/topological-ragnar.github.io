       <p class="subtitle">2018-2019</p>
       <p>A crystal is a spontaneously self-assembled repeating pattern of atoms.
         What does it mean that a pattern is repeating? It means that it has a <em>unit cell</em>,
       which is a small region which generates the whose crystal by a discrete group of translations.
     Thus a crystal is a pattern with a translation symmetry.</p>
     <p>Crystals can have other symmetries as well, such as rotations and reflections.
        In two dimensions there are exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group">17 ways</a> to combine translations with these other symmetries.
         In three dimensions there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group">230</a>.
         In four dimensions there are still more, and there are <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/602F11/References/Hiller.pdf">always finitely many.</a></p>
